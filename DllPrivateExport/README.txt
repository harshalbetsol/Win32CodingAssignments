Sir's Statement - Export in def file with private keyword - the exported symbol will not be visible in dumpbin
This project tests the statement. 
Conclusion : Statement was false. The symbol is still visible in dumpbin /exports after setting RIVATE in def file.
However I noticed that when private is used, dumbin /exports doesn't show the symbol in lib file, else it does.

Also, made a client to load the dll, and do get proc address for the private exported function. GetProcAddress() succeeded.

From msdn - The optional keyword PRIVATE prevents entryname from being included in the import library generated by LINK. It does not affect the export in the image also generated by LINK. (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hyx1zcd3.aspx)
