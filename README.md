# Win32batch-GokhleSir

2018 -  I had joined a win32 SDK class in Pune.
This repo contains all the code I wrote during the course of the class.

##List of technologies we learned.
* Windowing on Windows
	* Device context, painting, event driven architecture, message loop ...
	* Dialog boxes - modal, modeless
* Threading, DLL, implicit linking, explicit linking, load library
* COM
	* Class factory
	* Containment, Aggregation
	* Automation
	* RCW / CCW - Runtime callable wrapper (using native COM in .Net) / Com callable wrapper (using .Net components in native)
* .Net
* WinRt
 
## Installer fo final class project
	win32SdkProjectInstaller\Debug\win32SdkProjectInstaller.msi
**IMPORTANT: ** Open the .sln file in Visual Studio (2017) to see a proper folder structure. On disk file layout won't make much sense.


## System on which these code were written
 > Machine : Dell Precision 5510
 > Windows 10 16299 build (Enterprise 64 bit)
